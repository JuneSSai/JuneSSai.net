<h1>"Snap back to reality, ope, there goes gravity."</h1>
<br>
<p>Hi.</p>
<br>
<p>I'm starting to feel a little bit more "normal" again</p>
<p>I'm not panicking over nothing anymore</p>
<p>I'm not having a hard time to breathe anymore</p>
<p>I'm not crying anymore.</p>
<br>
<p>I'm not happy, don't get me wrong, I'll never be, either with myself nor anyone else</p>
<p>At one point everything will fall apart again, I'll end up breaking up again and I'll end</p>
<p>up back at step zero or worse again, mostly because I'm incapable of learning from my mistakes</p>
<p>Either because I'm still holding on for someone that left me years ago, or because my emotions</p>
<p>take the best out of me the moment they come into play.</p>
<p>and honestly, although I do care, and a lot, no matter how much I try to deny it, things eventually</p>
<p>just reach a point where I get tired of beating myself, so things just start to slow down again</p>
<p>and surely but slowly, I get a chance to breathe and regroup myself again, things are still bleak</p>
<p>and as hopeless as ever, but instead of feeling absolutely destroyed over it, I'm just done with it</p>
<p>Once again, back to ignoring it, until it eventually happens again.</p>
<br>
<p>So yes, I'm feeling a little bit better.</p>
<br>
<p>But I also want to try and change things up a little bit</p>
<br>
<p>I first created this site as a fun thing, and once again, like with everything I touch, it turned</p>
<p>sour very quickly, and my negativity quickly spilled over this site aswell</p>
<p>but I want to try and change that.</p>
<br>
<p>My first post was still pretty negative overall, but it was more something fun and interesting than</p>
<p>depressive, it was like a trip down the memory lane, and I want to try and bring and talk about things</p>
<p>I have a passion or I'm just straight up interested in talking about, so I'll try to hold some of the</p>
<p>more hopeless thoughts I've been gathering and writting again, and try to bring things that should fit</p>
<p>my initial intent with the site</p>
<br>
<p>I plan to talk about Quake, and how good movement on it and older FPSes feel, and a lil' bit of</p>
<p>speedrunning aswell, since Quake and speedrunning go together pretty well, and also, I've been watching</p>
<p>a lot of speedrunning videos, so there's that</p>
<br>
<p>Although, this might take a bit, because this week sincerely drained me, to the point I'd sit down to</p>
<p>write and do things, and I'd just sit and stare blankly at my screen for minutes if not hours trying</p>
<p>to come or think about what to write or talk about, and I feel genuinely uninspired to do anything</p>
<p>right now besides playing, and I've been mostly playing Quake and it's expansions recently, since</p>
<p>even the stuff I'd normally play in days like these just feels so wrong to me right now</p>
<p>So yes, don't expect the site to be updated daily (besides the daily quote and music recommendations)</p>
<p>since I could barely come up with anything even remotely interesting recently, but I'll try, trust me.</p>
<br>
<p>Also, about things like Discord, Newgrounds and/or social media in general</p>
<p>My Discord account is getting deleted, and that's definitive, and I don't want think I'll end up coming</p>
<p>back at all, same goes for Newgrounds, and although I wish I could, I also think it's better for me to</p>
<p>just avoid social media or those places in general, the amount of times I've fallen apart and decided</p>
<p>to leave, just to come back next week or so is quite concerning, and I don't want people to think I'm</p>
<p>only doing this because I'm desperate for attention, it's the last thing I want, so although the</p>
<p>Discord account is going down, I'll keep my Newgrounds up, and I might post new art or things I make</p>
<p>in there, I'll try to avoid getting to invested again, and in general, avoid interacting too much</p>
<p>either that might be events, community or whatever, I just feel like I really don't belong anywhere</p>
<p>and I'll try to keep it like that, not only to save myself the headache, but for others aswell.</p>
<br>
<p>So yeah, that's about it.</p>
<p>I'm feeling a lil' better, and I'm not losing my fucking head over nothing anymore</p>
<p>And if any of you (if there's anyone reading this at all) are interested, you're now free to</p>
<p>contact me once again, either it's on Newgrounds, Steam, E-Mail, or whatever.</p>
<p>Just give it a go, and I'll respond as soon as I can</p>
<br>
<p>And again; sorry for all the trouble.</p>
<br>
<p>But that's about it</p>
<p>I'll see you all around.</p>
