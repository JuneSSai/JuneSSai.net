<h1>"All it takes is one bad day for you</h1>
<h1>to go back to zero, or worse."</h1>
<br>
<p>I've started to write this post a few days ago, and I couldn't even think of the first</p>
<p>paragraph for this, and the reason?</p>
<p>I couldn't bring myself to stop crying, trying to remember why I even started to</p>
<p>write this to begin with.</p>
<br>
<p>There's so much going through my fucking head right now, things that I've been fighting</p>
<p>for about five years now, and some of them, through my whole life</p>
<p>And most would think I'd be over most of these things after so long, or at least that</p>
<p>I'd be used to it, that time would have made me strong or at least apathetic/indifferent</p>
<p>to at least a part of these things, that at this point I'd either be over it, or at</p>
<p>minimum, I would have learned how to live with all of the package I'm carrying</p>
<br>
<p>No.</p>
<br>
<p>I haven't got any better, in fact, despite the long time battling so I could finally</p>
<p>move on and try and have a decent life, things only have gotten worse</p>
<p>every day it feels like it's the first</p>
<p>It hurts just as bad as it ever did when I first started, and in some ways, the bleeding</p>
<p>only gets stronger as time goes by</p>
<p>instead of making me resilient, I'm only getting weaker and more unhinged.</p>
<br>
<p>I've met a lot of people recently, cool people, really cool people in fact</p>
<p>They got me into art and animating again, got me to recapture the feeling of being</p>
<p>part of a community and a friend group in general, and I've got tons of good laughs</p>
<p>and tons of good moments</p>
<p>But the moment I have to leave calls, or even just get away from the computer</p>
<p>everything just falls apart and starts to make no sense once again</p>
<br>
<p>I feel like a complete nuisance around everybody, and as hard as I try to dismiss this</p>
<p>more than ever, it just feels like reality is finally kicking in, and it's not just insecurity</p>
<p>speaking louder anymore.</p>
<br>
<p>No matter how many good people I might have in my life, I always end up pushing everyone away</p>
<p>from me, either because of how insufferable I am, how I tend to be extremely negative and</p>
<p>abrasive, or just because I push them away myself.</p>
<br>
<p>The feeling of being loved and accepted by someone or a group feels nice, but it never ceases</p>
<p>to break my heart, every time I see people getting invested in me or they genuinely start to</p>
<p>like me, it scares me like nothing else does</p>
<p>I'm scared of another dissapointment, I'm scared of another heartbreak, I'm scared of having to</p>
<p>see someone walk out of my life again because dealing with me is a task nobody has the patience</p>
<p>nor the will to deal with.</p>
<br>
<p>It sucks, and I'm so fucking tired of pretending it doesn't.</p>
<br>
<p>I'm not happy, I'm not satisfied, and I'm not even slightly ok, I haven't been "ok" even in the</p>
<p>slightest in these few years ever since 2017, and I'll probably never will be again.</p>
<br>
<p>I'm not even safe on my own sleep.</p>
<br>
<p>I've been having tons of weird dreams and nightmares, and most of them involving people I know</p>
<p>Most of them either dead, or people that simply decided to walked away</p>
<br>
<p>And it's fucking terrifying</p>
<br>
<p>I wake up in a cold sweat, thinking that life as it is right now is just another bad dream</p>
<p>and it's making even my nights of sleeps a living hell, to the point I'm trying to avoid to</p>
<p>sleep as much as possible, because even though it's not real, just the fact it reminds me of</p>
<p>how much I fucked up, not only my life but with the people I've met in here, will never not</p>
<p>make me cry.</p>
<br>
<p>And crying is something I've been doing a lot, despite how much I'm trying not to.</p>
<br>
<p>It's been raining hard in here</p>
<p>The walls of my room are falling apart, ceilings too, and every time it rains, my room just</p>
<p>floods entirely, and although I'm used to it at this point, it's still tiring</p>
<p>Nobody should be living at these conditions, and the fact this is something that happens</p>
<p>frequently, I just gave up entirely in keeping my room clean</p>
<p>The ground is dirty, full of powder and dust, hair and water, and I just can't muster up</p>
<p>strenght to get up and clean it one more time, because I know it's bound to happen again soon</p>
<p>So why bother?</p>
<br>
<p>The same goes to my house, this house is falling apart, and every time I remember I'm living in</p>
<p>here, around people that really don't like me, just gives me more reason to feel like being dead</p>
<p>is still my best option, despite the effort I went to change this</p>
<br>
<p>And I still miss her, a lot, and I wish things could have been different</p>
<p>I've had my happiest years around her, and I wish I could have gave her the value she deserved</p>
<p>Maybe if I did, things would have been more acceptable</p>
<p>But all I have now is her books and memories of happier days, and I can't let go</p>
<p>It still hurts just as bad as the first time, and in many ways, the heartache somehow just feels</p>
<p>worse as time goes by, and I've been crying a lot because of this single fact</p>
<p>I've finally had the chance to be alone, and the moment I do, my mind is just rushing with reminders</p>
<p>of how much of a piece of shit I am, and I've just sitted in my room crying for about two days now</p>
<p>I sit down, I look around, and all I have is a reminder that I'm better off dead</p>
<br>
<p>The dreams of going to see the world outside, have a good fullfilling relationship, having a nice</p>
<p>family, being able to turn into a better person and just having a decent life, is just that</p>
<p>Dreams.</p>
<p>Won't happen.</p>
<br>
<p>It's fucking disheartening to see that any progress I made will be in vain in the next month, because</p>
<p>the moment something manages to catch me off guard, I'll just go back to step zero, if not worse</p>
<p>It's legitimately tiring to see every effort you've made getting crushed like that</p>
<br>
<p>I try to learn new things, and I feel good about a week, but once that goes by, I feel shit, empty</p>
<p>I meet new people, and I enjoy being around them, but eventually doubts start kicking in, doubts</p>
<p>that I even have a place in the world at all</p>
<br>
<p>It's been like that for a good while now, and I say I got used to it, but it's a fucking lie</p>
<p>I'm a fucking lie
<p>I don't know what or who I am</p>
<p>I'm not sure what I want for myself anymore</p>
<p>I'm not sure what sorts of morals I should hold</p>
<p>I'm not sure what to do anymore</p>
<p>It's draining in a way that makes you feel absolutely empty, no matter how many incredible things</p>
<p>happen to you, or how many great friends you might have, you always end up feeling unfufilled</p>
<p>unsatisfied, miserable, hollow</p>
<br>
<p>And in all sincerity, this is none other than my fault</p>
<br>
<p>If I was a better son to my mother when she was still alive, I'd at least feel less guilty about</p>
<p>everything that happened, because even if she wasn't still around, I'd at least be able to sleep</p>
<p>with a clear conscience that she had a good son, a son that treated her the way she deserved to</p>
<p>be treated, not only as a person, but as a mother</p>
<br>
<p>If I was a better partner, I'd still be together with the girl I still hold so dearly next to my</p>
<p>heart, we probably would still be together, and I'd have a really special person next to me, one</p>
<p>that would be able to help me, so I could help her too, and no matter how much I claim to hate her</p>
<p>It's a fucking lie, I hate the fact she's not around anymore, because of how fucking selfish and</p>
<p>arrogant I can be,I hate the person I was and I still hate the person I am now.</p>
<br>
<p>I regret everything in life in general, from my decisions, the way I am, the things I decided to</p>
<p>have a passion for, the actions I took in bad faith and/or in the heat of the moment, and I hate</p>
<p>the fact that despite everything I tried and the best of efforts, nothing will change me</p>
<p>I can always change my appearance, change my name, or even the way people see me, but I'll always</p>
<p>be the same person in essence, and that will never not ruin my night.</p>
<br>
<p>I don't even have the fucking money to buy cigars for myself right now, and it fucking blows.</p>
<br>
<p>If you can take anything from this; don't be a piece of shit like me, simple as that.</p>
<br>
<p>I'm sorry if I dissapeared for like, two days, but not only I've been losing my fucking mind, but</p>
<p>my keyboard broke two days ago due to the leaks in my room, and I only noticed that it was leaking</p>
<p>water over my keyboard when it was too late, fortunately, my computer and the other things are still</p>
<p>functioning</p>
<br>
<p>I'm really fucking tired, and I'm really fucking done with everything, specially myself</p>
<p>But I'll try my best to not let this site die if possible</p>
<br>
<p>I'll overdose myself in antidepressants when I get the chance, but besides that, it's another fucking</p>
<p>year, and another fucking struggle</p>
<br>
<p>I'll catch you up soon</p>
<p>I hope you're having a good day</p>
<br>
<p>Until the next time.</p>
<br>
<p>Also, I'll still accept guestbook messages, but please, avoid trying to contact, talk or reach me in</p>
<p>any capacity unless it's absolutely necessary, thanks.</p>
