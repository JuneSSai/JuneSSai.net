<h1>The nostalgic feeling of the early 2000's internet, and why I miss</h1>
<h1>the decentralized era of the internet</h1>
<br>
<p>Wow, my first post, finaly!</p>
<p>And what a better way to start it than talking about what inspired me to >Learn HTML/CSS</p>
<p>and make this website to begin with?</p>
<p>Internet in the early 2000's, an era where internet where internet was still seen as a novelty</p>
<p>Rather than a game changer, something we'd NEED in our lifes on a daily basis, where instead of</p>
<p>Relying on big companies or websites for everything, you'd go into some random forum where some guy</p>
<p>Called "DickMaster445" on the "MegaDoom XL Forums" would explain you how to add a WAD file to your game</p>
<p>Or alternatively, when a kid that just so happens to know what he's doing makes a video in 144p with</p>
<p>Unregistered Hypercam 2 to record his notepad while "Trance - 009 Sound System Dreamscape" is blasting</p>
<p>on the background, yet somehow, most of the time, that would be enough to solve whatever problem you were having</p>
<p>or to teach you something you didn't knew before</p>
<br>
<p>Those were the great times.</p>
<p>Times that will never come back, unfortunately.</p>
