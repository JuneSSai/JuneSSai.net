<h1>The nostalgic feeling of the early 2000's internets</h1>
<h1>And why I miss the decentralized era of the internet</h1>
<br>
<p>Wow, my first post, finally!</p>
<p>And what a better way to start it than talking about what inspired me to learn HTML/CSS</p>
<p>and make this website to begin with, and in general, helped me shape the person I am</p>
<p>today? (I'm not sure if that's a good or a bad thing, but whatever.)</p>
<br>
<p>Internet in the early 2000's, an era where the internet was still seen as a novelty</p>
<p>rather than a game changer, something we'd NEED in our lifes on a daily basis, where instead of</p>
<p>relying on big companies or websites for everything, you'd go into some random forum where some guy</p>
<p>called "DickMaster445" on the "MegaDoom XL Forums" would explain you how to add a WAD file to your game</p>
<p>Or alternatively, when a kid that just so happens to know what he's doing makes a video in 144p with</p>
<p>Unregistered Hypercam 2 to record his notepad while "Trance - 009 Sound System Dreamscape" is blasting</p>
<p>on the background, yet somehow, most of the time, that would be enough to solve whatever</p>
<p>problem you were having, or to teach you something you didn't knew before</p>
<p>Or you'd just watch it because you had nothing better to do, and it was just fun to do so.</p>
<br>
<p>Those were the great times.</p>
<p>It was a time for discovery and fun, where nobody really gave a shit about their image (except for a few losers)</p>
<p>and all people were focused on was having a good time with strangers online, their friends, or whatever</p>
<p>they'd come across while exploring the wide web, the possibilities and potential were endless</p>
<br>
<p>But that's in the past, those were different times.
<p>Times that will never come back, unfortunately.</p>
<p>Why though? Is it because nobody wants it back anymore? What we have nowadays is better?</p>
<p>The answer is a little bit more complicated the more you try to think about it.</p>
<p>And it's mostly connected on how the internet evolved, and how the people who use it devolved.</p>
<br>
<p>And what do I mean by that?</p>
<p>Buckle up, buddy.</p>
<p>We're going down the memory lane.</p>
<br>
<img src="Images/EarlyHomeComputers.jpg" width="600" height="500">
<br>
<p>As I've pointed out in the beginning of this post, when the first home computers were introduced to the world</p>
<p>they were seem as nothing more than a simple novelty, mostly made for office jobs, like excels, docs, emails</p>
<p>and things among those lines, and I think this was specially true with things like emails.</p>
<br>
<p>Nowadays, things like instant messages, having calls or even sending emails is something incredibly superficial</p>
<p>anybody can learn how to do these things in about a minute, and with increased internet speeds, these types of</p>
<p>tasks aren't really a problem anymore, since sending and receiving files takes about the same time you'd take</p>
<p>reading a single paragraph of this post, if not faster</p>
<p>But that's the thing, "Nowadays", but back then, not only internet connections were way slower, but that was</p>
<p>a new technology being introduced to the world</p>
<p>it was revolutionary.</p>
<br>
<p>Distance didn't seem like a problem anymore, and barriers were quickly being broken as people started to explore</p>
<p>the possibilities with these new tools, a new world was opened, not only for those seeking to be professionals</p>
<p>but for those who were eager to explore and find new things, new cultures, new people, everything new, and the</p>
<p>first era of the internet was a golden age of curiosity and discovery, and once people started to hear about the</p>
<p>things the internet could do and offer you, everyone was eager to be a part of it</p>
<br>
<img src="Images/GeoCitiesExample1.jpg" width="600" height="500">
<br>
<p>People started to use internet and their home computers for more than just work, they started to use it for</p>
<p>their own entertainment, suddenly, the internet started to develop it's identity, a place where you could</p>
<p>do anything, create anything, post anything, share anything, it was like the wild west, what you were going</p>
<p>to do with it and who you were going to be on the internet was all up to you.</p>
<br>
<p>The internet started to gain a personal touch that's pretty much lost nowadays, and that was mostly prominent</p>
<p>on sites like GeoCities, where users would make their own web pages, they would either be like a personal page</p>
<p>or something completely random, at times being a incoherent mess filled with gifs and vivid colors</p>
<p>And man, was it cool.</p>
<br>
<img src="Images/GeoCitiesExample2.png" width="600" height="500">
<br>
<p>And now you're probably asking; "Uhm, are you sure? Are you sure you're not blinded by nostalgia</p>
<p>and it's making you have a poor judgement over something that probably wasn't even that good to begin with?"</p>
<br>
<p>And to that, I say "No".
<br>
<p>These old webpages were absolutely awesome, and they were a huge part on why surfing the web was so fun</p>
<p>Most of the might have been pretty amateur-ish, and even a mess, but every page had it's own distinct feeling</p>
<p>No page was the same, they all had a personal touch to them, even if they shared the same ideas or focuses</p>
<p>something would always make them memorable and unique among the crowd, either because of how the pages were</p>
<p>built, the content they had, or just because of how the person that created them wrote and did things</p>
<p>And this personal touch allowed people to create all sorts of sites, either to post and talk about things</p>
<p>they liked, or things they didn't, or just because they could, and with that, people would be inspired to</p>
<p>create and share things themselves, and that got us a lot of fun and creative stuff, like videogame websites</p>
<p>tutorial websites, fun and random websites, and even sites centered around user creations, some of them still</p>
<p>being a thing even nowadays, like Newgrounds, although Newgrounds didn't allow users to share content when it</p>
<p>it first came out, although that would quickly change, with it being one of the main participants on the</p>
<p>culture of creating and sharing your creations on the internet.</p>
<br>
<img src="Images/GeoCitiesExample3.jpg" width="600" height="500">
<br>
<p>And I cannot overstate how amazing this was back in the day</p>
<p>Out of nowhere, a lot of people that simply didn't fit well in society, either because the things they enjoyed</p>
<p>the way they acted or the things they created were heavily judged and ostracized from most if not all circles</p>
<p>But not anymore, now everyone could have their own little spaces, their own groups, and for once, feel like</p>
<p>they belong to somewhere.</p>
<br>
<p>And things didn't slow down there, since forums and online chats would quickly rise into popularity, not only</p>
<p>allowing for more freedom on what and where to share, but to interact with people in real time</p>
<p>either by text communication, or even voice and video calls, and there was plenty of choices to choose from</p>
<p>IRC, Mumble, MSN, Skype, Xat, Forums, it was all up to you.</p>
<br>
<img src="Images/XatExample.jpg" width="600" height="500">
<img src="Images/Doomworld2009.png" width="600" height="500">
<br>
<p>It was an amazing time to interact and make friendships, or just meet all sorts of weirdos, and one of the</p>
<p>things I really miss from that era, is that people weren't trying to appeal to anybody, they were just being</p>
<p>themselves, without a care in the world if people were happy about it or not</p>
<p>Instead of being constantly worried about filtering everything they said or being moderating theirselves 24/7</p>
<p>Every personality was pretty much distinct from each other, you'd meet all sorts of people, either they were</p>
<p>bad or not, and most if not all of these encounters would stick with you, and you'd be able to remember them</p>
<p>just because of how much impact they left when you had the chance to meet them, and I think this era of the</p>
<p>internet was defined by one word</p>
<p>"Personality".</p>
<br>
<img src="Images/MysticalForestZone.png" width="600" height="500">
<br>
<p>From the people, to the sites, the music, the way internet was shaped and how people shaped it, it all felt</p>
<p>really "personal", and everywhere you'd go, sites and the things you'd see in them would stick to you, even</p>
<p>years after you've first visited them, and I think one of the biggest examples of this happening with me was</p>
<p>with this site called "The Mystical Forest Zone", which was a site where you'd download Sonic sprites and at</p>
<p>You'd even have comic sections, and I'd visit it daily, not only because I just loved looking at the sprites</p>
<p>or because I'd always download them so I could make my shitty Sonic comics on MSPaint, but because the site</p>
<p>looked and felt amazing, it was a weird feeling of comfort and wonder I cannot describe, and even going back</p>
<p>to it nowadays wakes something up in me, and that goes for basicly everything made at that period</p>
<br>
<p>People would make things for themselves before anything or anyone else</p>
<p>Sharing with others was just a part of the fun, but not the whole point or the whole fun itself</p>
<br>
<p>And that allowed things to feel more unique from each other, with everyone having something distinct</p>
<p>about them and their works, and yes, of course people copied each other from time to time, but you'd still be</p>
<p>able to tell what or who they were copying just because of how memorable some of these personalities were</p>
<p>and I think there is a certain beauty to that, to know that the things you did or just you being yourself</p>
<p>was enough to make you special in someone else's eyes, even if you've never met this person in your life</p>
<p>and I think that turned specially true when YouTube got into the scene and started growing in popularity.</p>
<br>
<img src="Images/OldYouTube1.jpg" width="600" height="500">
<br>
<p>You were the star.</p>
<p>YouTube was something else back in the day</p>
<p>Since YouTube was a small site at that time, anyone would get a chance to be at the spotlight, and you'd</p>
<p>never run out of fun things to see, because instead of only giving the spotlight to very few creators</p>
<p>like how you see nowadays, you'd see new faces daily, and the videos you'd find where incredibly</p>
<p>interesting, not only because of how chaotic and random some of them were, but because of the wild ideas</p>
<p>some of these videos had, specially the sprite videos with Sonic characters living normal lifes with</p>
<p>real life photographs as backgrounds, all of them made in movie maker essentially as a slideshow</p>
<p>and using that old Windows XP voice to voice every character in the video</p>
<p>And man, I loved those.</p>
<br>
<img src="Images/OldSonicVideos.png" width="600" height="500">
<br>
<p>You'd see some truly crazy videos like "Sonic & Shadow's Halloween", "Amy and the cloning machine"</p>
<p>"Silver falls in love with black yoshi", and things among those lines, and the best part out of all</p>
<p>of that is that, all of these videos, no matter how ridiculous or poorly made they were, they were</p>
<p>legitimately some of the most fun you could had in the site, not only because they were legitimately</p>
<p>funny due to how ridiculous they were, but because you could feel that the person that made them</p>
<p>really enjoyed making those videos, you could feel like whoever was making these, was just happy</p>
<p>to make the things they liked, and they wanted to share the happiness with everyone else</p>
<p>And the fact most of the videos were all amateurish gave them a very unique feeling that's so hard</p>
<p>to recapture nowadays, specially since YouTube is a completely different beast nowadays, a beast that</p>
<p>kills any chance of you having any semblance of success unless you force yourself to do the things</p>
<p>everyone else is doing</p>
<p>And this change on focus to "everyone else" before "yourself" in my opinion, would essentially kill</p>
<p>one of the things that made the internet so fun to access to begin with.</p>
<br>
<p>We've talked about the rise</p>
<p>Now we're going to talk about the fall.</p>
<br>
<img src="Images/TwitterAndFacebook.jpg" width="600" height="500">
<br>
<p>I've been mostly talking about how everything felt incredibly unique and "personal", how even the</p>
<p>the most boring of sites or aspects of the internet were still pretty memorable just because of how</p>
<p>wild everything was, and because of that "personal" touch everything had on old user pages and even</p>
<p>on the content people used to create and share, and with the rise of social media with the likes of</p>
<p>Twitter and Facebook around 2012-2014, social media would destroy most of the things internet and</p>
<p>the people using it from the beginning cultivated from the very beginning.</p>
<br>
<p>TO BE CONTINUED.</p>
