<h1>Author's Comment</h1>
<p>This is just a quick thing I made, both as a test and as a curiosity</p>
<p>I'm done with the cutesy shit I've been doing in these past few years</p>
<p>and I tried to go for something edgier, same goes with the design of the site</p>
<p>and although I feel like I had a slight success achieving that in this piece</p>
<p>I'm not sure if I'd still call myself an artist, or if there's ever going to</p>
<p>be another one, since I feel like I'm done with art overall</p>
<br>
<p>In fact, that's going to be the topic of my next post; losing your passions.</p>
<br>
<p>And about the alt, I was just trying to experiment with stuff besides the</p>
<p>classic "Black background and red outlines character" and I just changed</p>
<p>and shifted some things around</p>
<br>
<p>The eye was specially interesting to make, looking from afar, it doesn't</p>
<p>look that convincing, but when looking closely, I think I did a decent job</p>
<p>at making a realistic texture for it</p>
<p>I also forgot to mention this was all made in Aseprite, as usual</p>
<br>
<p>But that's about it.
<p>I'll see you around.</p>
