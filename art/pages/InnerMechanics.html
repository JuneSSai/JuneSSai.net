<p>This is just a quick thing I made, both as a test and as a curiosity</p>
<p>I'm done with the cutesy shit I've been doing in these past few years</p>
<p>and I tried to go for something edgier, same goes with the design of the site</p>
<p>and although I feel like I had a slight success achieving that in this piece</p>
<p>I'm not sure if I'd still call myself an artist, or if there's ever going to</p>
<p>be another one, since I feel like I'm done with art overall</p>
<br>
<p>In fact, that's going to be the topic of my next post; losing your passions.</p>
<br>
<p>I'll see you around.</p>

Or better yet, I'll wake up dead!-->
