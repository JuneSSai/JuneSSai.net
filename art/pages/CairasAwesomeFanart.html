<h1>Author's Comment</h1>
<p>Well, it's quite ironic how every time I try to quit art, something always</p>
<p>seems to appear to bring me back to it once more, that's life, I guess?</p>
<br>
<p>I've had a pretty good time recently, that's mostly because I got to know</p>
<p>this cool little fella called BeatumPopcorn on Newgrounds</p>
<p>We spent a lot of time talking, and not only he's incredibly nice, but he also</p>
<p>got me into attempting to use my old tablet once again, and this time I actually</p>
<p>got it to work, so I decided to do something for him, since he deserves it</p>
<br>
<p>This is by far my favorite and most diverse piece all things considered</p>
<p>I went with this paper/rough sketch style since I'm attempting to shift my art</p>
<p>and works towards something with a lil' bit more of edge and attitude towards it</p>
<p>and although this art started as a test with me drawing Big Whiskey, it quickly</p>
<p>turned into this big fanart for Beatum, and I'm honestly happy with it</p>
<p>I hope you like it :)</p>
<br>
<p>I hope you're all are having a good night</p>
<p>I'll see you around.</p>
