<p>Welcome to my site, the site where I'll post all sorts of different shit</p>
<p>Either it's posts about me rambling about some dumb bullshit you might not be interested into</p>
<p>Or me talking about things I just like or don't, if it's in my mind, it's very likely in here too</p>
<br>
<p>My site is being updated very frequently, with more pages and features being added</p>
<p>as we speak, so come back often, you never know what's awaiting for you tomorrow!</p>
<p>Either way, I hope you enjoy your stay, make sure to leave a message too!</p>
<br>
  <h1>Updates</h1>
  <p>(Last Update: 04/23/2022)<span class="NewText">New!</span></p>

  <p>Added a new art piece to the gallery (The Linux Maniac)</p>
  <br>
  <p>Added a return button at the bottom of all art pages</p>

  <p>originally posted, and the last time they were modified or updated</p>
  <br>
  <p>Cleaned the HTML code for the main art page a little</p>
