<p>Welcome to my site, the site where I'll post all sorts of different shit</p>
<p>Either it's posts about me rambling about some dumb bullshit you might not be interested into</p>
<p>Or me talking about things I just like or don't, if it's in my mind, it's very likely in here too</p>
<br>
<p>My site is being updated very frequently, with more pages and features being added</p>
<p>as we speak, so come back often, you never know what's awaiting for you tomorrow!</p>
<p>Either way, I hope you enjoy your stay, make sure to leave a message too!</p>
<br>
  <h1>Updates</h1>
  <p>Last Update: May 1, 2022</p>
  <br>
  <p>Updated Beatum's first fanart with the finished version</p>
  <br>
  <p>Added "Cosmo636" and her works to the fanart page</p>
  <br>
  <p>A few easter eggs were readjusted, and more will receive the same treatment</p>
  <br>
  <p>Plans to update the fanart section with more artists will happen soon, but as of right now</p>
  <p>I'm very busy with my job and other things, so please, give me time.</p>
  <br>
