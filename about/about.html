<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm June. June S. Sai<br>
<p>I mostly do things for fun or for the sake of learning something new, like this site!</p>
<p>I'm a big fan of oldschool games, mostly games like Sonic, Worms, Doom, Quake, and many other games</p>
<p>In general, I'm just a fan of good things, no matter the genre, if it fits me, I'm happy.</p>
<p>I made this site with the intent of recreating the feeling of decentralized early 2000's internet</p>
<p>When everyone had their own private sites and posted everything and anything in them</p>
<p>hence why the style of the site is very simplistic and even the icons having a huge resemblance</p>
<p>to the userbars you'd find in oldschool forums on the internet</p>
<p>I hope you all will enjoy this site as much as I enjoyed making it</p>
<p>Peace.</p>
